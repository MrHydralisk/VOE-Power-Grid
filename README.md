# Vanilla Outposts Expanded: Power Grid

If you ever wanted to build a power plant outside of a colony, then this mod can help you with that.

## Mod Contents

Mod add few new outpost types to complement Vanilla Outposts Expanded. New outposts allowing you to build self-sufficient power plant, which should free some space for your colony base from large power generator grid.

Each Power Grid outpost have limited capacity for structures, which depends on Total Construction Skill lvl of pawns stationed in it (1 capacity per 1 lvl by default). To increase power production additional power generator buildings can be constructed from materials or from it minified version in outpost inventory. Construction work will be carried out by the most experienced pawn. Not needed buildings can be deconstructed. If capacity too low, then some buildings will get deactivated. They can be activated back via Power Grid UI tab. Power Grid can have terrain capacity and power multipliers, depending on where it created.

An outlet can be built on colony map to receive energy from one of Power Grid outposts. The bigger distance between power grid and outlet's map, the higher energy loss during transmission (1% per 2 tiles by default).

Power transmission towers can be constructed on each outpost to increase radius where outlet can connect to the power grid (+1 tile radius by default).

## Add/Remove

VOE: Power Grid mod should be safe to add to existing save. But when you want to remove it, better make backup save just in case.
